# NikBot - My Differential Drive Robot!
The goal of this project is to make a **differential drive** robot using ROS2. The robot will have teleoperations, mapping and localization, autonomous navigation, and object detection / following.

The robot can be simulated in a Gazebo environment or run on a real bot using raspberry pi and arduino.

This project is in a work in progress state.

## Completed:
- Github project init

## Current task:
- Robot's URDF
- Basic gazebo sim
